## Tic Tac Toe
Play tic-tac-toe against yourself, your friend, or against a computer on one
device.

In order to play a game, you'll need to make an account. You can also replay any
games you left unfinished.

Please note that this is a toy application. The user authorization is NOT secure.
Please do not use any passwords that you used anywhere else. I woudl also
recommend using a fake email.

## Motivation
This project was the first major assignment in General Assembly's Web Development
Intensive. The front-end is my work. General Assembly built the back-end using
Ruby on Rails.

The basic goals are to:
  <ul>
    <li>Have valid user authorization</li>
    <li>Generate games from the back end</li>
    <li>Place x and o game pieces on the board where the user clicks</li>
    <li>Not allow users to place pieces on already occupied space, or
    continue playing after the game ends.</li>
    <li>Indicate when a game ends, and how</li>
    <li>Retrieve each users' record of games played</li>
  </ul>

My personal stretch goals are:
  <ul>
  <li>Ability to switch between playing with a friend or against a computer</li>
  <li>A 'bomb' play to remove a piece, rather than add a piece (pending)</li>
  </ul>

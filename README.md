## Tic Tac Toe
Play tic-tac-toe against yourself, your friend, or against a computer on one
device.

In order to play a game, you'll need to make an account. You can also replay any
games you left unfinished.

Please note that this is a toy application. The user authorization is NOT secure.
Please do not use any passwords that you used anywhere else. I woudl also
recommend using a fake email.

## Motivation
This project was the first major assignment in General Assembly's Web Development
Intensive Program. The front-end is my work. General Assembly built the back-end using
Ruby on Rails.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [AJAX](https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Features
Users can sign up, sign in, change password, look up game records, and sign out
in the app.

There are two game modes - easy, and hot seat. The hot seat mode assumes that
two players are using one computer.
Users can pass the screen around and fill in the board. Easy mode is against a
computer that is randomly placing pieces in empty places on the board.
The computer makes its move after a one-second delay to simulate a real person.

## API Reference

This game's back end is a tic-tac-toe API built by General Assembly. Please see the documentation [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)

## How to use?
Visit the game [here](https://tarayoo.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
You will need to sign up first to get access to new games. Please do not use real
passwords or emails. This is a toy application.

## Future Goals
I'd like to clean up the classes, and ids in index.html to make the UI easier to
write and debug. The app, as of now, is not accessible.

## Credits
The game grid design is from Jenny Meade, one of the GA instructors.
The computer's random moves was calculated with a random number function from
MDN.
